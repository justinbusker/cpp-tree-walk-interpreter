## What is this

Attempting to implement jlox tree-walk interperter (originally written in java) in C++ to best of my ability

## Why

- I find interpreters / compilers very interesting and I want to know whats going on under the hood
- lower level practice, wanna get better at C++. This project I think will test my ability and will allow me to problem solve a lot of issues by myself since original implementation is in Java, so I cannot simply copy *everything*.
